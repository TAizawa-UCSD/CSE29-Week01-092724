//bad issues that cause shutting down softwares usually involves memory bugs.

ASCII of 'A' = 65, ASCII of 'a' = 97.
Converting uppercase to lowercase can be done by adding 32 or flipping the 5th bit.
There are bitwise operators for that: (c | 0b00100000)
  bitwise or(|) perform the operation on each bit of the inputs
  bitwise and(&)
